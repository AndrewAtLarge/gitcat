Using git-cat
-------------

Git-cat makes it possible to manage multiple git repositories from the command
line. Git-cat makes it possible to push and pull from multiple git repositories
to and from remote servers, such as bitbucket_ and github_, automatically
committing changes when necessary. As the aim of git-cat is to manage multiple
repositories simultaneously, the output from git commands is tailored to be
succinct and to the point.

Git-cat does not support all git commands and nor does it support the full
functionality of those git commands that it does support. Instead, it provides
a crude way of synchronising multiple repositories with remote servers. The
git-cat philosophy is to "do no harm" so, when possible, it uses dry-runs
before changing any repository and only makes actual changes to the repository
if the dry-run succeeds.  Any problems encountered by git-cat are printed to
the terminal.
